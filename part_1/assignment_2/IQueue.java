 * A queue typically, but not necessarily, order elements in a first-in-first-out
 * (FIFO). Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements
 * according to a supplied comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and
 * LIFO queues (or stacks) which order the elements last-in-first-out (LIFO).
 * Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is that element which would
 * be removed by a call to poll(). In a FIFO queue, all new elements are
 * inserted at the tail of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use different
 * placement rules.
